Microformats 2 support for Elgg
===============================

This is a very simple elgg plugin that provides basic Indieweb MF2 support to elgg.

It is build to be as unobtrusive as possible, and works by extending a number of core system
views with hidden MF2 attributes that can be picked up by a Microformats parser like Barnaby Walter's 
fantastic PHP parser <https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2>.

Primarily this was written to scratch an itch by allowing my distributed friending and PGP signin Idno 
extensions to work cross platform smoothly.
